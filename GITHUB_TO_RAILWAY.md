```

### 5. Deploy Using Scripts

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Setup Git and push to GitHub (if needed)
.\scripts\git-setup.ps1

# Deploy to Railway with full setup
.\scripts\railway-deploy.ps1 -SetupDB -Migrate -Seed
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Setup Git and push to GitHub (if needed)
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
./scripts/git-setup.sh

# Deploy to Railway with full setup
./scripts/deploy.sh --migrate
```

### 6. Manual CLI Steps (Alternative)
```bash
# Initialize Railway project
railway init

# Add PostgreSQL database
railway add postgresql

# Set environment variables
railway variables set NEXTAUTH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
railway variables set NODE_ENV="production"

# Deploy application
railway up

# Run database migrations
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy

# Seed database (optional)
railway run npx prisma db seed
```

## üîß Environment Variables Setup

### Required Variables
Set these in Railway dashboard or via CLI:

```bash
# Authentication (Railway will set DATABASE_URL automatically)
railway variables set NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-32-character-secret"
railway variables set NEXTAUTH_URL="https://your-app.railway.app"
railway variables set NODE_ENV="production"
```

### Optional Variables (for full functionality)
```bash
# OpenAI for AI features
railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-openai-key"
railway variables set OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4"

# AWS for file uploads
railway variables set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="AKIA..."
railway variables set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret"
railway variables set AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
railway variables set AWS_S3_BUCKET="claimflow-uploads"

# SendGrid for email notifications
railway variables set SENDGRID_API_KEY="SG..."
railway variables set SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL="noreply@yourdomain.com"

# Google Cloud for OCR
railway variables set GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT_ID="your-project"
railway variables set GOOGLE_CLOUD_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----..."
railway variables set GOOGLE_CLOUD_CLIENT_EMAIL="service@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

Railway automatically provides PostgreSQL when you add it:

```bash
# Add PostgreSQL service
railway add postgresql

# Run migrations
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy

# Seed database with sample data
railway run npx prisma db seed

# Connect to database (optional)
railway connect postgresql
```

## ‚úÖ Verification Steps

### 1. Check Deployment Status
```bash
railway status
```

### 2. View Application Logs
```bash
railway logs
```

### 3. Test Health Endpoint
Visit: `https://your-app.railway.app/api/health`

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z",
  "database": "connected",
  "uptime": 123.45
}
```

### 4. Test Application
Visit: `https://your-app.railway.app`

## üîß Post-Deployment Configuration

### 1. Custom Domain (Optional)
```bash
# Add custom domain
railway domain add yourdomain.com

# Or via dashboard: Project Settings ‚Üí Domains
```

### 2. Environment-Specific Settings
```bash
# Production optimizations
railway variables set NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED="1"
railway variables set PORT="3000"
```

### 3. Monitoring Setup
- Enable Railway metrics in dashboard
- Set up error tracking (optional)
- Configure alerts for downtime

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Build Failures
```bash
# Check build logs
railway logs --deployment

# Common fixes:
railway variables set NODE_VERSION="18"
railway variables set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION="false"
```

#### 2. Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Verify DATABASE_URL is set
railway variables

# Check database status
railway status

# Reconnect database
railway add postgresql
```

#### 3. Environment Variable Issues
```bash
# List all variables
railway variables

# Check for missing required variables
railway variables set NEXTAUTH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
railway variables set NEXTAUTH_URL="https://$(railway status --json | jq -r '.deployments[0].url')"
```

#### 4. Migration Failures
```bash
# Reset and re-run migrations
railway run npx prisma migrate reset --force
railway run npx prisma migrate deploy
railway run npx prisma db seed
```
