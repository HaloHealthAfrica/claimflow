# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ClaimFlow is a HIPAA-compliant web application that streamlines the insurance claims process for patients. The system enables users to digitally manage their insurance information, submit claims through automated data extraction, receive AI-powered assistance for medical coding, validate claims before submission, and track claim statuses with automated appeals generation. The application combines OCR technology, AI-powered medical coding assistance, and secure data handling to create a comprehensive claims management platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a patient, I want to create an account and securely authenticate, so that I can access my personal claims management dashboard.

5. IF a user enters invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages without revealing account existence

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a patient, I want to add my insurance information through OCR scanning or manual entry, so that I can use it for claim submissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an insurance card image THEN the system SHALL extract insurer name, member ID, group ID, payer ID, and address using OCR
2. WHEN OCR extraction completes THEN the system SHALL display extracted data for user confirmation and editing
3. WHEN a user confirms insurance information THEN the system SHALL securely store the encrypted profile linked to their account
4. IF OCR fails to extract data THEN the system SHALL provide manual entry forms as fallback
5. WHEN insurance information is saved THEN the system SHALL validate required fields before storage

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a patient, I want to upload receipts and have the system automatically extract claim data, so that I can quickly create claims without manual data entry.

#### Acceptance Criteria

5. IF receipt OCR fails THEN the system SHALL allow manual claim creation with empty form fields

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a patient, I want AI assistance to suggest appropriate CPT and ICD codes when they're missing, so that my claims have the correct medical coding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a claim lacks CPT or ICD codes THEN the system SHALL analyze the claim context and suggest appropriate codes
2. WHEN AI suggests codes THEN the system SHALL display code descriptions and confidence percentages
3. WHEN a user selects suggested codes THEN the system SHALL add them to the claim
4. WHEN multiple code options exist THEN the system SHALL present them in order of confidence with clear descriptions
5. IF AI cannot suggest codes THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to contact their healthcare provider

### Requirement 5

2. WHEN validation finds errors THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages with correction guidance
3. WHEN validation finds warnings THEN the system SHALL show potential issues that may affect processing
4. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL display a confidence score and approval likelihood
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent claim submission until errors are resolved

### Requirement 6

3. WHEN PDF generation occurs THEN the system SHALL include all required claim information in standard format
4. WHEN submission completes THEN the system SHALL update the claim status and notify the user
5. WHEN submission fails entirely THEN the system SHALL log the error and provide user guidance

### Requirement 7

5. WHEN a claim is denied THEN the system SHALL display the denial reason and suggest next steps

### Requirement 8

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a claim is denied THEN the system SHALL offer to generate an AI-powered appeal letter
2. WHEN generating an appeal THEN the system SHALL analyze the denial reason and create appropriate response arguments
3. WHEN an appeal is generated THEN the system SHALL format it as a professional PDF ready for submission
4. WHEN appeal generation completes THEN the system SHALL allow user review and editing before download
5. WHEN a user downloads an appeal THEN the system SHALL track the appeal in the claim timeline

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a patient, I want my personal health information secured and encrypted, so that my privacy is protected according to HIPAA requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria
